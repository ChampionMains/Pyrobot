# FAQ

## What is this?
{:id="what" name="what"}

This is a service which enables user flairs on participating /r/ChampionMains subreddits which
indicates your **League of Legends** ranked tier, champion mastery level, and champion mastery
points.


## Who made this?
{:id="maker" name="maker"}

This site was made by [/u/LugnutsK](https://www.reddit.com/u/LugnutsK), and is a heavily modified 
version of [this service](https://summonerschool.reddit.com/comments/3z0bzu/) made by
[/u/Kivinkujata](https://www.reddit.com/u/Kivinkujata).


## Do we really this?

It was requested that there becomes an easier way to manage the various “Mastery Points
Leaderboards” which multiple Champion Main subreddits made use of. Moderators of these subreddits
wished for their community members who had achieved a significant number of Mastery Points to be
recognised for their achievement.
This was made available through using flairs and adding Mastery Icons to people’s exisiting flairs
on the subreddit. We were limited to keeping a system like this extremely exclusive to avoid having
too much manual labour required from the moderators who are already busy keeping their own
subreddit(s) moderated so providing a solution which would allow users to assign these icons to
their flairs themselves which ensuring it was not misused or abused was highly desired.


## What is a [/r/ChampionMains](https://ChampionMains.reddit.com/) subreddit?
{:id="need" name="need"}

The ChampionMains Subreddits are subreddits which are dedicated to the fanbase of a particular
champion. For example, players can use [/r/ZyraMains](https://ZyraMains.reddit.com/) to create
discussions and share content with each other about Zyra.


## What is a Mastery Points Leaderboard?
{:id="leaderboard" name="leaderboard"}

> The Mastery Points Leaderboard was an idea brought to me by /u/Deejayce who was Moderator of
> /r/VarusMains. He wanted a leaderboard where Varus players could display their mastery and sort of
> compete with each other to have the most or a significant number of mastery points on their
> champion.

## What does this have to do with assigning people flairs?
However, there wasn’t really anyway to acknowledge people’s achievement in obtaining such a
significant number of mastery points. This notion was shared with the other Moderators of other
Champion Mains subreddits and the idea became quickly popular amongst their respective subreddits
too.
Initially, we began adding text to user’s flairs saying “300K+ Mastery Points” for example but it
wasn’t really that eye-catching or desirable. Then we began using the new level 6 and 7 mastery
icons, adding them to the end of people’s existing flairs. Using the level 6 mastery icon for people
above 300K mastery points on their champion and the level 7 mastery icon for people over 500k
mastery points. People enjoyed seeing these awesome icons added to the flairs and those eligible for
them loved that their hard earned mastery points could be acknowledged in some way.


## Why use Mastery Icons to recognise people’s Mastery Points? It doesn’t make sense…
It wasn’t very intuitive for users to use Mastery Icons to recognise someone’s Mastery Points.
Ideally we could assign Mastery Icons to people who had that Mastery Level, but because of the ever
increasing number of players who are achieving their Mastery Levels on the champion it would become
a struggle to maintain and upkeep everybody’s flairs.
There also weren’t really any other assets which looked as fancy to recognise Mastery Points, but
because of the number of Achievement posts being shared on the various Champion Mains subreddits, it
was clear that people valued their achievement of hitting that Level 6 and 7 Mastery Level very much
and it would be unfair to not allow them to show that on their flair when it’s actually possible for
them to do so.
Then to allow people with a significant number of Mastery Points to be recognised on our subreddits,
we added a small prestige icon as well which would display what milestone that Summoner has reached
in their Mastery Points for that champion.


## How did you make this?
We knew that /r/SummonerSchool had a bot which would allow users to add their Summoner Name, verify
they owned that account and then retrieve their rank and display it as a flair on their subreddit.
/u/Kivinkujata who made that bot had openly encouraged others to branch and make changes to it. And
so, /u/LugnutsK aimed to adapt the flair bot of /r/SummonerSchool to also retrieve a Summoner’s
Rank, Mastery Level and Mastery Points too.
We deemed that users could benefit from displaying their rank just as /r/SummonerSchool does. Not
everyone’s Reddit Name corresponds to their Summoner Name so sometimes people never realised they
were discussing ideas with a Challenger player.
This does not in any way mean that a player in Challenger or has a Mastery Level of 7 on the
Champion is always right, just as it doesn’t make everything a Gold or Mastery Level 5 player false.


## Which subreddits can I use this on?
We’ve made this available for all Champion Mains subreddits. If you’re a moderator of a Champion
Main subreddit and wish for this to be added to your subreddit, send /u/LugnutsK a message to let
him know!


## I don’t want this. I’m happy with the flairs as they are.
That is fine, you can keep your existing flairs just how they currently are. There is nothing that
you have to anywhere. This is an opt-in process, just like the Mastery Points Leaderboard, only do
it if you want to. If you opt-in and then decide you’ve changed your mind, you can always delete
your Summoner Name from the system.
This should never impact your experience of using a Champion Main subreddit. Any form of abuse as a
result of this should be reported to the moderator team immediately.
Any comments along the lines of “Mastery 7 and still stuck in Bronze” or such will be removed and
the user will be warned. Further action may be taken where appropriate.


## I like being able to show my Rank/Mastery Level but I don’t want to show my Mastery Level/Rank.
That is totally fine. On your profile under the ‘Subreddit Flair Settings’ you can set which icons
are displayed on your flair. You can tick/untick the boxes to show/hide that icon and manage them
for each Champion Main subreddits.
As mentioned above, anyone form of abuse portrayed through this system will be taken seriously and
should be reported to the moderators of that subreddit. Just because somebody is okay to show their
Mastery Level and not their Rank should not affect their experience on our subreddits. Mastery
achievements are here to recognise people’s achievement; it is not a competition!


## Is it secure?
The flair service was written with your security in mind. It neither stores, nor acquires access to
any of your personally identifying information. Linkage to Reddit and Riot occur through secure,
publicly accessible APIs -- the same ones used by most Reddit bots (like AutoModerator) and League
fansites (like LolKing).
Source Code will be available via GitHub. You're encouraged to branch and make changes. If you find
an issue, report it. Of course, you can always fix it yourself - please send a pull request.
